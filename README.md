**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: K V N AISWARYA LAKSHMI DEVI

**INTERN ID**: CT08HIU

**DOMAIN**: DATA SCIENCE

**BATCH DURATION**: DECEMBER 30th, 2024 to JANUARY 30th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTOSH

**DESCRIPTION**:
The sentiment analysis project involved cleaning text data, creating a word cloud, and training a machine learning model. Text preprocessing included removing special characters, tokenization, and lemmatization to prepare the data for analysis. A word cloud visualization provided insights into the most common words in the dataset, helping to understand the sentiment.

A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was used to train the model, learning patterns between words and sentiment labels. The model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its ability to classify sentiments effectively. Future improvements could focus on hyperparameter tuning and exploring more advanced techniques.

**OUTPUT**:
The output can be seen in the uploaded jupyter notebook.
